# AskData 🏆

AskData was born out of a simple yet frustrating question: *Why is finding insights in open data so painful?* Built during the Abu Dhabi Hackathon, this AI-powered search engine makes querying public datasets as easy as having a conversation. Instead of sifting through endless rows of data from csv/sheets, just ask a question and get straight-to-the-point answers—like magic, but powered by **Next.js, TypeScript, and OpenAI**.

The goal? To make open data *actually* usable. What started as an idea for participating in a hackathon ended up placing **Runners-up**
